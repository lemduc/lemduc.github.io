## Windows Users: Using WSL2 and rbenv

If you are developing or building this site on Windows, it is highly recommended to use [WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) for a smoother Unix-like development experience.

To manage Ruby versions easily, use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) inside your WSL2 environment:

1. **Install WSL2**: Follow the [official Microsoft guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to set up WSL2 and a Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu).
2. **Install rbenv**: Follow the [rbenv installation instructions](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) to install rbenv and ruby-build in your WSL2 shell.
3. **Install Ruby**: Use rbenv to install the required Ruby version:
   ```sh
   rbenv install 3.1.2  # or the version required by this project
   rbenv global 3.1.2
   ```
4. **Install Bundler and Jekyll**:
   ```sh
   gem install bundler jekyll
   bundle install
   ```
5. **Build and serve the site**:
   ```sh
   bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
   ```

This setup ensures compatibility and avoids common issues with native Windows Ruby environments.
